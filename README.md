# aiovantage

aiovantage is a Python library for interacting with and controlling Vantage InFusion home automation controllers.

Uses a *controller* pattern inspired heavily by the [aiohue](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/aiohue) library.

This open-source, non-commercial library is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Vantage, and is provided for interoperability purposes only.

## Example

```python
from aiovantage import Vantage

async with Vantage("192.168.1.2", "username", "password") as vantage:
    async for load in vantage.loads:
        print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")
```

See the [examples](examples) folder for more examples.

## Features

- Uses Python asyncio for non-blocking I/O.
- Exposes "controllers" to make fetching and controlling various objects easy.
- Uses SSL connections by default, with automatic reconnection.
- Fetch objects lazily (with `async for obj in controller`).
- Alternatively, eager-fetch objects with `controller.initialize`.

## Supported objects types

The following interfaces/controllers are currently supported.

If you have an object that you expect to show up in one of these controllers, but it is missing, please let me know in an issue.

## Installation

Add `aiovantage` as a dependency to your project, or install it directly:

```shell
pip install aiovantage
```

## Usage

### Creating a client

Begin by importing the `Vantage` class:

```python
from aiovantage import Vantage
```

The most convenient way to create a client is by using the async context manager:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    # ...use the vantage client
```

Alternatively, you can manage the lifecycle of the client yourself:

```python
from aiovantage import Vantage

vantage = Vantage("hostname", "username", "password")
# ...use the vantage client
vantage.close()
```

### Querying objects

The `Vantage` class exposes a number of *controllers*, which can be used to query objects. Controllers can either be populated lazily (by using `async for`), or eagerly (by using `controller.initialize()`).

For example, to get a list of all loads:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    async for load in vantage.loads:
        print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")
```

Alternatively, you can use `controller.initialize()` to eagerly fetch all objects:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    await vantage.loads.initialize()
    for load in vantage.loads:
        print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")
```

If you aren't interested in the state of the objects, you can call `controller.initialize(fetch_state=False)` to slightly speed up the initialization:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    await vantage.loads.initialize(fetch_state=False)
    for load in vantage.loads:
        print(f"{load.name}")
```

All controllers implement a django-like query interface, which can be used to filter objects. You can either query by matching attributes:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    async for load in vantage.loads.filter(name="Kitchen"):
        print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")
```

Or by using a filter predicate:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    async for load in vantage.loads.filter(lambda load: load.level > 50):
        print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")
```

### Fetching a single object

You can fetch a single object by id, by calling `controller.aget()` or `controller.get()`:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    load = await vantage.loads.aget(118)
    print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")
```

These functions also implement the same query interface as `controller.filter()` for querying by
attributes or filter predicate:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    load = await vantage.loads.aget(name="Kitchen")
    print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")
```

### Controlling objects

Most controllers expose a various methods for controlling the state of objects. The first parameter to these methods is always the vantage id of the object to control.

For example, to turn on a load:

```python
async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    await vantage.loads.turn_on(118)
```

### Subscribing to state changes

You can subscribe to state changes by using the `controller.subscribe()` method:

```python
def on_load_state_change(event, load, data):
    print(f"{load.name} is at {load.level}%")

async with Vantage("hostname", "username", "password") as vantage:
    vantage.loads.subscribe(on_load_state_change)
    await vantage.loads.initialize()
```

Note that a subscription will only receive state changes for objects that have populated into the controller.
